// . Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object.

//The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name.

//. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments.

//  Call the function with the required information and two other name value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature.
// Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.
