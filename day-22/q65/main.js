// Question 65: Determine the Remainder: Make a function that gets two numbers and shows the leftover from dividing them using the % sign. For example, remainder(5, 2) should give 1.
//solve
function remainder(a, b) {
    return a % b;
}
// Example usage:
const result = remainder(5, 2);
console.log(`The remainder of 5 divided by 2 is ${result}.`); // Output: The remainder of 5 divided by 2 is 1.
