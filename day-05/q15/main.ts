// Question 15: Changing Guest List: One of your guests can't make it to the dinner, so you need to send out a new set of invitations with a replacement guest.

let guestList: string[] = ["Quaid-e-Azam", "Sir Zia", "Rafay Baloch"];

let absentGuest: string = "Quaid-e-Azam";
let newGuest: string = "Bill Gates";
guestList[0] = newGuest;

for (let i = 0; i < guestList.length; i++) {
  console.log(
    `\n\nDear Sir ${guestList[i]} ,\nIt is our pleasure to invite you in our party.\nThank you!`
  );
}
console.log(`\nSir ${absentGuest} is not coming to the party.\n`);
