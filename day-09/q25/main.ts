// **Question 25:** Alien Colors #1: Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Assign 'green', 'yellow', or 'red' to a variable called `alien_color`.

//Create a variable called alien_color
let alienColor: string = "green";

//write if statement to test whether the alien's color is green. If it is print a message that the player just earn 5 points.

if (alienColor === "green") {
  console.log("Plyer just earn 5 points !");
}

// Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that fails. (The version that fails will have no output).

alienColor = "yellow ";

if (alienColor === "green") {
  console.log("Plyer just earn 5 points !");
}
