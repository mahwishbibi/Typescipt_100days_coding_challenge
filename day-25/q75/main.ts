// Question 75: Compound Assignment Operators: Use compound assignment operators to simplify arithmetic operations. Start with x = 4 and perform a series of operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on x using compound operators.

function performOperations() {
    let x: number = 4;

    // Addition
    x += 2; // Equivalent to: x = x + 2

    // Subtraction
    x -= 1; // Equivalent to: x = x - 1

    // Multiplication
    x *= 3; // Equivalent to: x = x * 3

    // Division
    x /= 2; // Equivalent to: x = x / 2

    console.log("Final value of x:", x);
}

// Call the function to see the output
performOperations();
